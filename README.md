# Medical-info

In this project we created a UML model, after which we provided a description of the system for users by developing an E-R diagram to model and describe the database. In the end we implemented the system in Access making use of queries, thus achieving an interactive interface for the user. 

To test the project, open the "access" folder and open the file 'project' with Microsoft Access.
